### Video Title:
Week 1 – Session 3 | Tools in Data Science (TDS)

### What I Learned:
- Continued the **Tools in Data Science (TDS)** course with a deeper view of the toolset and technology landscape used in data science workflows.
- Learned what different categories of tools are commonly used by data science practitioners, including statistical packages, programming languages, and data formats. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
- Understood that some tools focus on visualizing and exploring data, while others help build predictive models or automate tasks. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
- Learned about the role of **programming languages** like Python and R in data science, and why Python is widely used due to its simplicity and rich library ecosystem. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- Understood the importance of **data formats** such as JSON and XML and how they are used to structure and exchange data in real applications. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
- Learned how the choice of tools and data formats impacts how efficiently data workflows can be executed and communicated. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

### Concepts Covered:
- Types and purposes of data science tools
- Statistical software vs programming languages
- Role of data formats (JSON, XML) in data processing
- Python and R as key languages for data science tasks

### Key Outcomes:
- Gained a clearer understanding of how different tools fit into the data science workflow.
- Understood the importance of choosing the right tools based on the task, such as analysis, visualization, or model building.
- Realized the foundational role of programming languages like Python for daily data science work.
